Paper code: [https://github.com/simplescaling/s1/tree/6fe78bd9cc6362b585e6f35db2282d0c384a461d](https://github.com/simplescaling/s1/tree/6fe78bd9cc6362b585e6f35db2282d0c384a461d)

## Resource Usage
- With our settings, the SFT training run takes 110 minutes on a single H100 GPU.
- Inference takes ~5 minutes per setting across all datasets. We ask for 16 settings to get 80 GPU-minutes.
- This replication took ~3 hours of H100 GPU time.

## Replication Notes
Here, we provide important notes on our replication and ways that our task/replication differs from the original paper or it's code.

### Task Differences
- We give the agent the starting set of 59k problems. We do not have the agent gather and collate data from multiple math and MC online datasets.
- For these 59k problems, we also provide the Gemini Flash Thinking API completions (to save time and money from the agent doing these itself). We also annotate the dataset with whether Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct got the correct answer (to reduce required GPU hours). Additionally, we label each datapoint with its Mathematics Subject Classification (MSC) first-level category, which was done in the paper with Claude-3.5-Sonnet, which would be costly and slow to include in our agent evaluation. However, we do ask the agent to write code that determines whether the Gemini completions are correct, to filter for low-quality questions, to design and implement sampling procedures to make the dataset more uniform across the MSC categories, as well as difficulty and data quality filtering.
- We used the `Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct` model instead of `Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct`. We observe similar scaling behavior, but the 3B model is much faster to train and evaluate.
- We ask the agent to evaluate on only the first 100 problems of each dataset instead of the full dataset to save GPU time.

- We ask our agent to reproduce the main results in the paper (but not every figure and table):
    - We have the agent 1) curate data for SFT training (but not perform many ablations on its procedure) 2) do SFT training 3) test a variety of test-time scaling methods (but not hyperparameter settings used in the paper)
    - We do have the agent produce test-time scaling plots for MATH, AIME24, and GPQA (Figure 1 in paper)
    - We do not produce have the agent produce Figures 2 and Table 1 in the paper, which mostly involve collating the published performance numbers of other methods.
    - We do not ask the agent to perform data ablation experiments (Table 2), since this requires GPU intensive retraining + inference each time.
    - We ask for a version of Table 3 without Token and Step-conditional control, which both require retraining the model. However, we do require an additional (computationally cheaper) Truncation baseline. We also ask for an additional Budget Error metric, which will help reviewers better understand the controllability of the thinking budget for the methods the agent implements.
    - We do have the agent perform extrapolation experiments like Table 4 (i.e. scaling beyond when the model would naturally stop with budget forcing $n > 1$), but do not have it experiment with different 'Wait'-tokens, in order to reduce GPU requirements for the evaluation.
    - We do not ask the agent to compare against parallel best-of-N majority voting or REBASE baselines as in Figures 4 (right) and 7 in the original paper, because these are very computationally expensive.
    - We do not have the agent perform rejection sampling experiments like in Figure 6 because rejection sampling is very computationally expensive.
    - We do ask for sampled outputs from the model (like Figure 5 in the paper) to be included in the final report.

### Replication Differences from the Original Codebase
- SFT Training:
    - During SFT training, we divided the block_size or max_seq_length in half to get 16384, to save on GPU memory and run on a single 80GB GPU. This means that test-time scaling past 16384 tokens may result in lower performance.
    - We also used the Adafactor optimizer instead of AdamW, again to save on GPU memory and run on a single 80GB GPU.

## Target Results

Here we provide our results alongside reference comparisons to figures and tables in the original s1 paper.

### 1. Final Performance Comparison

<div align="center">

</div>

**Figure 1.** For truncation and budget forcing methods, we see consistent improvements in performance on the math datasets as we increase the amount of test-time compute (up to a point, after which we see a drop-off in performance). On GPQ, there is no clear trend with the 3B model we use (this holds for all scaling methods). Truncation generally seems like the best method across the Pareto frontier. Dots are plotted with transparency, so the brownish points are places where truncation (blue) and budget forcing (orange) overlap. (We note that Figure 1 in the original paper only shows budget forcing result.)

<div align="center">
<img src="./test_time_scaling_truncation.png" alt="Truncation test-time-scaling plot" width="100%" />
</div>

**Figure 2.** Truncation caps amount of test-time compute used, but does not increase it. We annotate each point with the maximum number of tokens allowed. We see consistent improvements (nearly 20% on MATH and 7% on AIME24) in raising the truncation cap, up to a point. After 4000 thinking tokens, even when using a cap of 8000 tokens or 'auto' (which means no truncation), the number of tokens used saturates around 4000 for MATH and 6000-7000 for AIME24. This is far short of the 16000 maximum training context length we used.

<div align="center">
<img src="./test_time_scaling_forcing.png" alt="Budget forcing test-time-scaling plot" width="100%" />
</div>

**Figure 3.** Budget forcing not only truncates thinking tokens, but also increases test-time compute by suppressing the end-of-thinking token $n$ times and adding a 'Wait' token each time. In Figures 1 and 3, we see that budget forcing and truncation behave quite similarly at low amounts of test-time compute (since we truncate before the end-of-thinking token is suppressed). At higher ranges, applying budget forcing at $n = 1, 2, 4$ increases thinking tokens used by a small amount, but not by many. In the examples, we show that this is because after budget forcing is applied, the model soon tries to output the end-of-thinking token again, after a few steps of logic. Ultimately, the small increases in thinking tokens do not actually improve performance over truncation in our experiments. We hypothesize that this is because we use a very small model that does not handle extremely long reasoning traces well (note that we observe dips in performance wrt thinking tokens slightly earlier than in the original s1 paper with a 32B model). We also compare our results with budget forcing at $n > 1$ with Figure 4 and Table 4 in the original paper. We see that we get similar overall thinking token counts with budget forcing, which only slightly increases the token count, and has noisy effects on accuracy.

<div align="center">
<img src="./test_time_scaling_class_conditional.png" alt="Class-conditional test-time-scaling plot" width="100%" />
</div>

**Figure 4.** Finally, we consider class-conditional forcing (using one prompt encouraging 'short' reasoning traces and another encouraging 'long' reasoning traces). This does not substantially change the amount of test-time compute used, with the long prompt using only slightly more thinking tokens than the short prompt. On MATH, both achieve comparable accuracy, with the long prompt doing 1% worse. On AIME24 however, the long prompt solves about 2x more problems than the short prompt. Ultimately simple prompting achieves reasonable absolute scores, but offers less control over the reasoning trace length and does not outperform truncation and budget forcing.

<div align="center">
<img src="./reference_figure_1.png" alt="Reference - Figure 1 in the original s1 paper" width="60%" />
</div>

**Reference - Figure 1 in the original s1 paper.** They use a 32B model, so they get better absolute performance as well as higher slopes on scaling behavior. Larger models also continue to scale for longer (e.g. the 3B model starts to drop off near 8000 thinking tokens on AIME24, but the 32B model continues to scale well here, although eventually also drops off at 16000 tokens, as shown in Figure 7 of the s1 paper). We do not get returns on scale on GPQA for our model, unlike in their original 32B setup.


### 2. Quantitative Scaling Metrics Table

**MATH Dataset:**
| Method            | Control   | Budget Error   |   Scaling | Max Performance   |
|:------------------|:----------|:---------------|----------:|:------------------|
| Truncation        | 100%      | 10.7%          |     4.801 | 69.0%             |
| Forcing           | 100%      | 5.0%           |     2.332 | 68.0%             |
| Class Conditional | 50%       | 183.3%         |    -2.078 | 62.0%             |

**AIME24 Dataset:**
| Method            | Control   | Budget Error   |   Scaling | Max Performance   |
|:------------------|:----------|:---------------|----------:|:------------------|
| Truncation        | 100%      | 1.1%           |     0.748 | 6.7%              |
| Forcing           | 100%      | 2.1%           |     0.038 | 6.7%              |
| Class Conditional | 50%       | 306.5%         |   104.493 | 6.7%              |

**GPQA Dataset:**
| Method            | Control   | Budget Error   |   Scaling | Max Performance   |
|:------------------|:----------|:---------------|----------:|:------------------|
| Truncation        | 100%      | 10.9%          |     0.3   | 39.0%             |
| Forcing           | 100%      | 5.4%           |    -0.755 | 37.0%             |
| Class Conditional | 50%       | 182.1%         |    -2.726 | 29.0%             |

**Table 1.** See the task instructions for more details on the metrics. We find that budget forcing generally allows for more precise control over the reasoning trace length (mostly at high budgets, since we can force more thinking than truncation). Truncation generally has the best scaling behavior and the highest maximum performance. Class-conditional control has low controllability in general. Generally, the short vs long prompts lead to only small differences in tokens used, but can have significant performance impacts, which is why the scaling coefficients are so extreme on AIME24 (nearly same token usage but a moderate difference in performance leads to a huge slope).

<div align="center">
<img src="./reference_table_3.png" alt="Reference - Table 3 in the original s1 paper" width="45%" />
</div>

**Reference - Table 3 in the original s1 paper.** In the original paper, they generally observe better scaling behavior with the larger model in addition to better absolute performance, as expected. We do not use token-conditional and step-conditional baselines to reduce the GPU requirements for the evaluation, since these require expensive retraining.

### 3. Example Samples

Full samples available in `s1/eval/results`. Here are a few example samples (edited to fix latex rendering issues):

#### Truncation at 4000 thinking tokens (sample 1 from MATH test set -- **Correct**):

**User:**
Define
$$ p = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} \quad \text{and} \quad q = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3} $$
Find a way to write
$$ \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} $$
in terms of $p$ and $q.$

**Thinking:**
The problem asks us to express the sum $\sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$ in terms of $p = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2}$ and $q = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3}$.

Let's first write out the first few terms of the double sum:
$$
    S = \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} \\
    = \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{(j + 1)^3} + \frac{1}{(j + 2)^3} + \frac{1}{(j + 3)^3} + \cdots \right)
$$
Consider the inner sum with respect to $k$:
$$\sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$$
Let $m = j + k$. As $k$ goes from $1$ to $\infty$, $m$ also goes from $\infty$ to $\infty$. When $k = 1$, $m = j + 1$. So,
$$\sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \sum_{m = j + 1}^\infty \frac{1}{m^3} $$

So, the double sum becomes
$$ S = \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \left( \sum_{m = j + 1}^\infty \frac{1}{m^3} \right) $$
$$ S = \sum_{m = 2}^\infty \sum_{j = 1}^{m - 1} \frac{1}{m^3} $$
Here, the inner sum is $\sum_{j = 1}^{m - 1} \frac{1}{m^3} = (m - 1) \frac{1}{m^3}$.

So, we have
$$ S = \sum_{m = 2}^\infty (m - 1) \frac{1}{m^3} $$
$$ S = \sum_{m = 2}^\infty \frac{m - 1}{m^3} = \sum_{m = 2}^\infty \frac{1}{m^2} - \frac{1}{m^3} $$

Let's write out the terms:
$$ S = \left( \frac{1}{2^2} - \frac{1}{2^3} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{3^2} - \frac{1}{3^3} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{4^2} - \frac{1}{4^3} \right) + \cdots \\ = \left( \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{8} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{9} - \frac{1}{27} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{16} - \frac{1}{64} \right) + \cdots $$
$$ S = \left( \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{3^2} + \frac{1}{4^2} + \cdots \right) - \left( \frac{1}{2^3} + \frac{1}{3^3} + \frac{1}{4^3} + \cdots \right) $$
$$ S = \sum_{m = 2}^\infty \frac{1}{m^2} - \sum_{m = 2}^\infty \frac{1}{m^3} $$

We know that $p = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2}$ and $q = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3}$.
So, $\sum_{m = 2}^\infty \frac{1}{m^2} = p - \frac{1}{1^2} = p - 1$.
And $\sum_{m = 2}^\infty \frac{1}{m^3} = q - \frac{1}{1^3} = q - 1$.

Therefore,
$$ S = (p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - 1 - q + 1 = p - q $$

Let's double-check the calculations.

The interchange of summation is valid because the terms are positive and decreasing.

Alternative approach:
Consider the product of the two sums:
$$ \left( \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{j^3} \right) \left( \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} \right) = \left( \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{j^3} \right) p $$
Let $S = \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$.
Consider the term where $j = k$:
$\frac{1}{(j + j)^3} = \frac{1}{(2j)^3} = \frac{1}{8j^3}$

Consider the term where $j + k = 2m$, so $k = 2m - j$.
$\frac{1}{(2m)^3} = \frac{1}{8m^3}$. As $j$ goes from $1$ to $\infty$, $m$ goes from $1$ to $\infty$.
When $j = 1$, $k = 2m - 1$. When $j \to \infty$, $k \to \infty$.
$$ \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} $$
Let $m = j + k$. As $j$ goes from $1$ to $\infty$, $m$ goes from $2$ to $\infty$.
When $j = 1$, $m = k + 1$. When $j \to \infty$, $m \to \infty$.
$$ \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \sum_{m = 2}^\infty \frac{1}{m^3} $$

Consider the product:
$$ \left( \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{j^3} \right) \left( \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} \right) = \left( \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{j^3} \right) \left( \sum_{m = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{m^2} \right) $$
Let $S = \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$.
$$ S = \sum_{m = 1}^\infty \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + m)^3} $$
$$ S = \sum_{m = 1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{(1 + m)^3} + \frac{1}{(2 + m)^3} + \frac{1}{(3 + m)^3} + \cdots \right) $$
$$ S = \sum_{m = 1}^\infty \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(m + j)^3} $$

Consider the identity:
$$ \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^p} \sum_{l = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{l^q} = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \sum_{l = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^p l^q} $$

Consider the identity:
$$ \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{a_n}{n^p} \sum_{m = 1}^\infty \frac{b_m}{m^q} = \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \sum_{m = 1}^\infty \frac{a_n b_m}{n^p m^q} $$

Consider the sum:
$$ T = \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} $$
Let $m = j + k$. As $j$ goes from $1$ to $\infty$, $m$ goes from $2$ to $\infty$.
$$ T = \sum_{m = 2}^\infty \sum_{j = 1}^{m - 1} \frac{1}{m^3} = \sum_{m = 2}^\infty (m - 1) \frac{1}{m^3} = \sum_{m = 2}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{m^2} - \frac{1}{m^3} \right) $$
$$ T = \left( \frac{1}{2^2} - \frac{1}{2^3} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{3^2} - \frac{1}{3^3} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{4^2} - \frac{1}{4^3} \right) + \cdots $$
$$ T = \left( \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{8} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{9} - \frac{1}{27} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{16} - \frac{1}{64} \right) + \cdots $$
$$ T = \left( \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{3^2} + \frac{1}{4^2} + \cdots \right) - \left( \frac{1}{2^3} + \frac{1}{3^3} + \frac{1}{4^3} + \cdots \right) $$
$$ T = \sum_{m = 2}^\infty \frac{1}{m^2} - \sum_{m = 2}^\infty \frac{1}{m^3} $$
$$ T = (p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - q $$

Consider the identity:
$$ \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^p} \sum_{m = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{m^q} = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \sum_{l = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^p l^q} \delta_{kl} $$
where $\delta_{kl}$ is the Kronecker delta.

Consider the sum:
$$ \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} $$
Let $m = j + k$. As $j$ goes from $1$ to $\infty$, $m$ goes from $2$ to $\infty$.

**Thinking:**

... (begins exactly the same as above because we used zero-temperature sampling. But note that the model already had the correct answer by this point, so additional tokens and budget forcing is not needed)

$$ \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^p} \sum_{m = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{m^q} = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \sum_{l = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^p l^q} \delta_{kl} $$
$$ = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^{p+q}} $$

Consider the sum:
$$ \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} $$
Let $m = j + k$. As $j$ goes from $1$ to $\infty$, $m$ goes from $2$ to $\infty$.
$$ = \sum_{m = 2}^\infty \sum_{j = 1}^{m - 1} \frac{1}{m^3} = \sum_{m = 2}^\infty (m - 1) \frac{1}{m^3} = \sum_{m = 2}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{m^2} - \frac{1}{m^3} \right) $$
$$ = \left( \frac{1}{2^2} - \frac{1}{2^3} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{3^2} - \frac{1}{3^3} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{4^2} - \frac{1}{4^3} \right) + \cdots $$
$$ = \left( \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{8} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{9} - \frac{1}{27} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{16} - \frac{1}{64} \right) + \cdots $$
$$ = \sum_{m = 2}^\infty \frac{1}{m^2} - \sum_{m = 2}^\infty \frac{1}{m^3} $$
$$ = (p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - q $$

Consider the identity:
$$ \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{a_n}{n^p} \sum_{m = 1}^\infty \frac{b_m}{m^q} = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \sum_{l = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^p l^q} a_k b_l $$

Consider the sum:

Let $m = j + k$. As $j$ goes from $1$ to $\infty$, $m$ goes from $2$ to $\infty$.
$$ = \sum_{m = 2}^\infty \sum_{j = 1}^{m - 1} \frac{1}{m^3} = \sum_{m = 2}^\infty (m - 1) \frac{1}{m^3} = \sum_{m = 2}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{m^2} - \frac{1}{m^3} \right) $$
$$ = \left( \frac{1}{2^2} - \frac{1}{2^3} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{3^2} - \frac{1}{3^3} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{4^2} - \frac{1}{4^3} \right) + \cdots $$

$$ = (p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - q $$
**'Wait'** the interchange of summation is not completely justified because the terms are not strictly decreasing.

Let's write out the sum:
$$ S = \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} $$
Consider the terms where $j + k = 2m$, so $k = 2m - j$.
$$ \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(2m)^3} = \frac{1}{8m^3} $$
As $j$ goes from $1$ to $\infty$, $m$ goes from $1$ to $\infty$.
When $j = 1$, $k = 2m - 1$. When $j \to \infty$, $k \to \infty$.
$$ S = \sum_{m = 1}^\infty \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + m)^3} $$
Let $m = j + k$. As $j$ goes from $1$ to $\infty$, $m$ goes from $2$ to $\infty$.
$$ S = \sum_{m = 2}^\infty \sum_{j = 1}^{m - 1} \frac{1}{m^3} = \sum_{m = 2}^\infty (m - 1) \frac{1}{m^3} = \sum_{m = 2}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{m^2} - \frac{1}{m^3} \right) $$
$$ = \left( \frac{1}{2^2} - \frac{1}{2^3} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{3^2} - \frac{1}{3^3} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{4^2} - \frac{1}{4^3} \right) + \cdots $$
$$ = \left( \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{8} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{9} - \frac{1}{27} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{16} - \frac{1}{64} \right) + \cdots $$
$$ = \sum_{m = 2}^\infty \frac{1}{m^2} - \sum_{m = 2}^\infty \frac{1}{m^3} $$
$$ = (p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - q $$
**'Wait'** the range of $m$ should be from $m = j + 1$ to $\infty$.

$$ S = \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} $$
Consider the term for a fixed $m$.
When $j = 1$, $k = m - 1$. When $j \to \infty$, $k \to \infty$.
$$ \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(m + j)^3} $$
Let $m = j + k$. As $j$ goes from $1$ to $\infty$, $m$ goes from $2$ to $\infty$.
$$ S = \sum_{m = 2}^\infty \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(m + j)^3} $$
Let $m + j = n$. As $j$ goes from $1$ to $\infty$, $n$ goes from $2$ to $\infty$.
When $j = 1$, $n = m + 1$. When $j \to \infty$, $n \to \infty$.
$$ S = \sum_{m = 2}^\infty \sum_{n = m + 1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3} $$
$$ = \sum_{n = 3}^\infty \sum_{m = 2}^{n - 1} \frac{1}{n^3} = \sum_{n = 3}^\infty (n - 2) \frac{1}{n^3} = \sum_{n = 3}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{n^2} - \frac{2}{n^3} \right) $$
$$ = \left( \frac{1}{3^2} - \frac{2}{3^3} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{4^2} - \frac{2}{4^3} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{5^2} - \frac{2}{5^3} \right) + \cdots $$
$$ = \left( \frac{3}{9} - \frac{2}{27} \right) + \left( \frac{4}{16} - \frac{2}{64} \right) + \left( \frac{5}{25} - \frac{2}{125} \right) + \cdots $$
$$ = \left( \frac{1}{3} - \frac{2}{9} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{4} - \frac{2}{64} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{5} - \frac{2}{125} \right) + \cdots $$
$$ = \left( \frac{3 - 2}{9} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{32} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{5} - \frac{2}{125} \right) + \cdots $$
$$ = \frac{1}{9} + \left( \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{32} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{5} - \frac{2}{125} \right) + \cdots $$
$$ = \frac{1}{9} + \left( \frac{8 - 1}{32} \right) + \left( \frac{25 - 2}{125} \right) + \cdots $$
$$ = \frac{1}{9} + \frac{7}{32} + \frac{23}{125} + \cdots $$
This does not seem to simplify nicely.

Back to the first approach:
$$ S = \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \left( \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} \right) = \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \left( \sum_{m = j + 1}^\infty \frac{1}{m^3} \right) $$
$$ = \sum_{m = 2}^\infty \left( \sum_{j = 1}^{m - 1} \frac{1}{m^3} \right) = \sum_{m = 2}^\infty (m - 1) \frac{1}{m^3} = \sum_{m = 2}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{m^2} - \frac{1}{m^3} \right) $$
This approach seems correct and the result is $p - q$.

**End-of-thinking token and start of Answer:**

Solution:
Let the given sum be $S$. We have
$$ S = \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} $$
Consider the inner sum with respect to $k$:
$$ \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \sum_{m = j + 1}^\infty \frac{1}{m^3} $$
Substituting this into the outer sum, we get
\[S = \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \left( \sum_{m = j + 1}^\infty \frac{1}{m^3} \right) = \sum_{m = 2}^\infty \left( \sum_{j = 1}^{m - 1} \frac{1}{m^3} \right).\]
The inner sum is a constant with respect to $j$, so we can take the sum over $j$:
\[S = \sum_{m = 2}^\infty (m - 1) \frac{1}{m^3} = \sum_{m = 2}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{m^2} - \frac{1}{m^3} \right).\]
We can split the sum:
\[S = \sum_{m = 2}^\infty \frac{1}{m^2} - \sum_{m = 2}^\infty \frac{1}{m^3}.\]
We know that $p = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2}$ and $q = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3}$.
So, $\sum_{m = 2}^\infty \frac{1}{m^2} = p - \frac{1}{1^2} = p - 1$.
And $\sum_{m = 2}^\infty \frac{1}{m^3} = q - \frac{1}{1^3} = q - 1$.

Therefore,
\[S = (p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - q.\]

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{p - q}$

**User:**

Define
$$p = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} \quad \text{and} \quad q = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3}.$$ Find a way to write
$$\sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$$ in terms of $p$ and $q.$

Answer after a long amount of thinking. If you feel like you are finished early, spend the extra time trying to double-check your work until you are absolutely sure that you have the correct answer.

**Thinking:**
The problem asks us to express the sum $\sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$ in terms of $p = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2}$ and $q = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3}$.

Let's first write out the first few terms of the double sum:
$$ \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \left( \frac{1}{(1+1)^3} + \frac{1}{(1+2)^3} + \frac{1}{(1+3)^3} + \dots \right) \\ \quad + \left( \frac{1}{(2+1)^3} + \frac{1}{(2+2)^3} + \frac{1}{(2+3)^3} + \dots \right) \\ \quad + \left( \frac{1}{(3+1)^3} + \frac{1}{(3+2)^3} + \frac{1}{(3+3)^3} + \dots \right) + \dots $$
$$ = \frac{1}{2^3} + \frac{1}{3^3} + \frac{1}{4^3} + \dots \\ \quad + \frac{1}{3^3} + \frac{1}{4^3} + \frac{1}{5^3} + \dots \\ \quad + \frac{1}{4^3} + \frac{1}{5^3} + \frac{1}{6^3} + \dots + \dots $$
The terms are symmetric with respect to $j$ and $k$, so we can rewrite the sum by summing over $j < k$:
$$ \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = j+1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} + \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^j \frac{1}{(j + k)^3}. $$
The first part of the sum is
$$ \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = j+1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{(j + j + 1)^3} + \frac{1}{(j + j + 2)^3} + \dots \right) = \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = j+1}^\infty \frac{1}{(2j + k)^3}. $$
Let's change the index in the inner sum: let $m = k - (j+1)$. Then $k = m + j + 1$, and when $k = j+1$, $m = 1$. When $k \to \infty$, $m \to \infty$.
$$ \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{(2j + 1)^3} + \frac{1}{(2j + 2)^3} + \dots \right) = \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{m = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(2j + m)^3} $$
We can interchange the order of summation:
$$ \sum_{m = 1}^\infty \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(2j + m)^3} = \sum_{m = 1}^\infty \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(2j + m)^3}. $$
We can interchange the order of summation:
$$ \sum_{m = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{m^3} \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(2j)^3} = \sum_{m = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{m^3} \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{8j^3} = \frac{1}{8} \sum_{m = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{m^3} \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{j^3} = \frac{1}{8} \left( \sum_{m = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{m^3} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{8} q^2. $$

Now consider the second part of the sum:
$$ \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^j \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \sum_{j = k}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{(k + k)^3} + \frac{1}{(k + k + 1)^3} + \dots \right) = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \sum_{m = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(2k + m)^3}. $$
$$ \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3} \sum_{m = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(2m)^3} = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3} \sum_{m = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{8m^3} = \frac{1}{8} \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3} \sum_{m = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{m^3} = \frac{1}{8} p q. $$

So, the original sum is
$$ \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \frac{1}{8} q^2 + \frac{1}{8} p q = \frac{1}{8} (q^2 + pq). $$

Let's double-check the calculations.

The interchange of summation is valid since the terms are non-negative.

Alternative approach:
Consider the double sum directly. Change the order of summation:
$$ \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{(1+k)^3} + \frac{1}{(2+k)^3} + \dots \right). $$
Let $n = k$. The sum becomes
$$ \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \sum_{j = 1}^k \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{(k + k)^3} + \frac{1}{(k + k + 1)^3} + \dots \right) = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \sum_{m = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(2k + m)^3}. $$
$$ = \sum_{m = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(2k + m)^3} = \sum_{m = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{m^3} \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(2k)^3} = \sum_{m = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{m^3} \frac{1}{8} \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3} = \frac{1}{8} p q. $$

Now consider the other term:
$$ \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{(j + 1)^3} + \frac{1}{(j + 2)^3} + \dots \right). $$
Change the order of summation:
$$ \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{(1+k)^3} + \frac{1}{(2+k)^3} + \dots \right). $$
Let $n = k$.
$$ = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \sum_{j = 1}^k \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{(k + k)^3} + \frac{1}{(k + k + 1)^3} + \dots \right) = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \sum_{m = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(2k + m)^3}. $$
$$ = \sum_{m = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(2k + m)^3} = \sum_{m = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{m^3} \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(2k)^3} = \sum_{m = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{m^3} \frac{1}{8} \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3} = \frac{1}{8} p q. $$

Let's verify the interchange of summation. Consider the sum
$$ S = \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3}. $$
We can rewrite the sum by summing over $j$ first:
$$ S = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{(1+k)^3} + \frac{1}{(2+k)^3} + \dots \right). $$
Let $m = k$. This gives
$$ S = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{(k + k)^3} + \frac{1}{(k + k + 1)^3} + \dots \right) = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \sum_{m = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(2k + m)^3}. $$
Interchanging the order of summation:
$$ S = \sum_{m = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(2k + m)^3} = \sum_{m = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{m^3} \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(2k)^3} = \sum_{m = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{m^3} \frac{1}{8} \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3} = \frac{1}{8} \sum_{m = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{m^3} \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3} = \frac{1}{8} p q. $$

Now consider the other part:
$$ \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{(j + 1)^3} + \frac{1}{(j + 2)^3} + \dots \right). $$
Summing over $j$:
$$ = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \sum_{j = 1}^k \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{(k + 1)^3} + \frac{1}{(k + 2)^3} + \dots \right). $$
Let $m = k$.
$$ = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{(k + 1)^3} + \frac{1}{(k + 2)^3} + \dots \right) = \sum_{m = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = m}^\infty \frac{1}{(k + 1)^3}. $$
Interchange the order of summation:
$$ = \sum_{m = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(m + 1)^3} \sum_{k = m}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3} = \sum_{m = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(m + 1)^3} \left( \sum_{k = m}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3} \right). $$
We know that $\sum_{k = m}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3} = \left( \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3} \right) - \left( \sum_{k = 1}^{m-1} \frac{1}{k^3} \right) = q - \left( \sum_{k = 1}^{m-1} \frac{1}{k^3} \right)$.
So, the second part is
$$ \sum_{m = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(m + 1)^3} \left( q - \sum_{k = 1}^{m-1} \frac{1}{k^3} \right). $$
This does not seem to simplify nicely.

Let's go back to the first approach.
The sum is symmetric with respect to $j$ and $k$.
Consider the terms in the sum:
$$ \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} $$
Consider fixing $j$. The inner sum is $\sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$.
We know that $\sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3} = q$.
Consider the sum $\sum_{k = j+1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3} = \left( \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3} \right) - \left( \sum_{k = 1}^j \frac{1}{k^3} \right) = q - \frac{1}{j^3} \sum_{k = 1}^j \frac{1}{k^3} \approx q - \frac{1}{j^3} j^3 = q - 1$ for large $j$.

Let's consider the structure of the sum.
$$ \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \sum_{m = 1}^\infty \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + m - j)^3} = \sum_{m = 1}^\infty \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{m^3} = \sum_{m = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{m^3} \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{j^3} = q \sum_{m = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{m^3} = q^2. $$
This is wrong, the inner sum is over $k$.

Let's consider the terms in the sum:
$$\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$$
If $j = 1$, then $\frac{1}{(1+k)^3}$.
If $k = 1$, then $\frac{1}{(j+1)^3}$.

Consider the first few terms:
$j=1, k=1: \frac{1}{2^3}$
$j=1, k=2: \frac{1}{3^3}$
$j=1, k=3: \frac{1}{4^3}$
$j=2, k=1: \frac{1}{3^3}$
$j=2, k=2: \frac{1}{4^3}$
$j=2, k=3: \frac{1}{5^3}$

Summing over the first few terms:
$j=1: \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{27} + \frac{1}{64} + \dots$
$j=2: \frac{1}{27} + \frac{1}{64} + \frac{1}{125} + \dots$

Let's rewrite the sum:
$$ \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \sum_{m=1}^\infty \frac{1}{(n + m)^3} $$
where $n = j$ and $m = k$.

Consider the sum $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{(1+n)^3} + \frac{1}{(2+n)^3} + \dots \right)$.
Consider the sum $\sum_{m=1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{(1+m)^3} + \frac{1}{(2+m)^3} + \dots \right)$.

Let's consider the interchange of summation carefully.
We have $\sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$.
Consider the inner sum $\sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$.
Let $m = k - 1$. Then $k = m + 1$.
When $k=1$, $m=0$.
$\sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \sum_{m = 0}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + m + 1)^3}$.
This does not seem helpful.

Let's go back to the expression we obtained:
$$ \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = j+1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} + \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^j \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} $$
The first part $= \frac{1}{8} q^2$.
The second part $= \frac{1}{8} p q$.

Consider the sum $\sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$.
Fix $j$. The sum is $\sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3}$.
We know that $\sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3} = q$.

Consider the sum $\sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = j+1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + j + 1)^3} + \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + j + 2)^3} + \dots$
$= \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(2j + 1)^3} = \frac{1}{8} \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(2j)^3} = \frac{1}{8} \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{8j^3} = \frac{1}{64} \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{j^3} = \frac{1}{64} q$.

Consider the sum $\sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^j \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + 1)^3} + \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + 2)^3} + \dots$
$= \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + 1)^3} + \left( \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + 1)^3} - \frac{1}{8} \right) + \left( \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + 1)^3} - \frac{1}{9} \right) + \dots$
This approach seems complicated.

The interchange of summation is valid because the terms are positive.
